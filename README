Shiny bits for you, fresh off the presses.

The code is broken up into different modules, based off a bottom up
approach, with each file intending to be used with the struct provided
in it's header file.

bool
====

C89 doesn't give a boolean type (or define TRUE or FALSE).

date_time
=========

Has the functions for parsing and producing the strings of any time
and dates.

event
=====

Each entry in the calendar is an event, each event includes a date and
a time.

event_list
==========

This is what would be considered the calendar in memory. It is a
linked list of all the events, has the functions you would expect. It
also has iterator type functions so any callers don't need to know the
internals of the linked list.

calendar_file
=============

This is used for loading and saving calendars (event_list) to disk in
the required format.

assignment_state
================

Defines a struct that is passed around the various GUI callbacks.

ui_assignment
=============

The GUI code, just brings all the different event_list and
calendar_file functions together to provide the user interface.

assignment
==========

The main file, it's very simple, all it does is attempt any loading of
a calendar file from the command line and start the GUI.
